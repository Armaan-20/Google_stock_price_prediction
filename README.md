Google Stock price prediction using LSTM
Importing the Dataset:
The dataset is available on https://www.superdatascience.com/deep-learning/
There are two .csv file containing the train and test dataset respectively.
The training dataset contains the stock prices starting form 3rd Jan 2012 till 30th dec 2016.
The test dataset conatins the stock prices starting from 3rd Jan 2017 till 31st dec 2017.
To predict the stock price, here I have considered the last 70 days data to train the model for every subsequent next day.
